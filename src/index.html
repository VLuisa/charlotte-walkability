                <h2>Exploring "walkable" areas in Charlotte, NC based on what matters to me</h2>
                <p>By Luisa Vasquez</p>
            </div>
            <p>I moved to Charlotte less than a year ago. And one of the things I still cannot get used to is that I have to drive everywhere.</p>
            <p>I used to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts; a suburb across the river from Boston filled with cobblestone sidewalks, ivy-covered brick buildings, and most memorably to me — easily accessible amenities that were all within walking distance.</p>
            <h2>A picture of a perfect weekend</h2>
            <p>To me, a great weekend includes getting some books at the library, curling up to read them on a picnic blanket, and grabbing coffee at a cute coffee shop with some friends.</p>
            <p>When I lived in Cambridge, all of these things were simple to do and easy to walk to while listening to some tunes.</p>
            <h5>Number of times I could listen to Olivia Rodrigo's <em>'Driver's License</em></h5>
            <p>While walking to the library in Cambridge...</p>
            <img src="imgs/chart-1.png" />
            <p>If I walked to the library from where I live in Charlotte...</p>
            <img src="imgs/chart-2.png" />
            <p>The 11 minute walk to the library in Cambridge is much more reasonable than a 1 hour and 40 minute walk in Charlotte.</p>
            <p>According to Google Maps the majority of the walk to the library in Charlotte would be along a high speed road that doesn't have a sidewalk. I couldn't safely travel this route.</p>
            <h2>Walkability vs. Car culture</h2>
            <p>While chatting with other Charlotte transplants who came from various cities, I noticed that everyone had a different definition of what makes an area “walkable”, based on what matters to them.</p>
            <p>Some come from cities with a big car culture and do not care about walkability when choosing where to live — they are content to drive everywhere.</p>
            <p>Walkability is important to me, and until now I have always lived in walkable neighborhoods.</p>    
            <p>I had joked that I would deem an area walkable if I could walk to the library and a cute coffee shop in 20 minutes.</p>    

            <h2>Where could I live in Charlotte?</h2>
            <p>I had a hunch that my low-estimation of Charlotte's walkability was colored by the exact area I live in, and likely doesn't reflect the experience of living everywhere in the city limits.</p>
            <p>So I decided to create a personal “walkability index” based on my preferences, to determine whether there is anywhere in Charlotte that would meet my walkability criteria.</p>
            <p>Unlike the <a href="https://epa.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=f16f5e2f84884b93b380cfd4be9f0bba">national walkability index</a>, that takes a variety of factors into account, my hypothetical "index" is based on my own criteria: access to libraries and coffee shops.</p>

        <h2>Walking in Charlotte</h2>
        <p>My walkability criteria is personal to me. There are other aspects to walkability that urban planners measure that I didn't account for - such as taking into consideration public transportation and biking, or thinking about pedestrian safety. Although my index measures where it's possible to walk to, it also don't take into account whether that walk would be pleasurable, scenic, or comfortable.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10vh">But whether it's highly accurate or not, this criteria gives me an idea of areas that I can explore in Charlotte that fit my ideal lifestyle. Like many other cities, the most walkable areas of Charlotte are its urban center and the surrounding neighborhoods. I guess these are the neighborhoods I need to move to so I can walk to the library, grab some books, and then read them while sipping on a cup of coffee. </p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>For calculating walkable areas I used atlas.co to calculate two isochrones for traveling 20 minutes on foot from each point. I dissolved the isochrones from each point into a shape: one for libraries and one for coffee shops.  The final “walkable” regions were calculated by taking the intersection of the two aforementioned isochrone shapes.</p>
        <p>For library data I used a dataset of <a href="https://data.charlottenc.gov/datasets/2624c30596134e2591056e53709eba4b/explore">Libraries from the City of Charlotte Open Data</a> portal. For coffee shops I queried Open Street Map data for “cafe” type amenities on March 13, 2024 and manually removed any coffee shops in the Airport. I removed any libraries or coffee shops that sat outside of the city limits, even if they were technically designated to Charlotte.</p>
